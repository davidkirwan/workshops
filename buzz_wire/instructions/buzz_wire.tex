During this workshop, attendees build a buzz wire game system. The aim of which is to guide a loop through a wire maze without touching the wire. Each participant receives a pack containing all the components required to build the game. No prior soldering experience is required, training will be provided on the day. The only requirement the will to learn, and a packed lunch!
