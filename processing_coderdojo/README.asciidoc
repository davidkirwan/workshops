== Processing Workshop ==
Processing workshop where students will use a Java based programming language to generate images from shapes and colour, which they will then animate and control with keyboard inputs. This creative coding workshop focuses on algorithmic design and animation and will be delivered by South East Makerspace (SEMS) member's Aileen Drohan (visual artist) and David Kirwan (developer). At the end of the workshop each student will have their own unique visual output and the skills to expand upon what they have learned.
