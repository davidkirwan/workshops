In conclusion while this research was necessarily limited by the available time and resources, never the less a contribution to new knowledge was made through the development of supporting open source tools and resources which might enable further research in this field in the future. There are many opportunities with several existing large radio telescope arrays, such as the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) and the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), while others are in the early planning stages and are due to be built in the near future like the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). I am encouraged to continue working on this and similar topics and I am currently considering applying to a doctoral program which might allow the pursuit of a research career in astronomy.
